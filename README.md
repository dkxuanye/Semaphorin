## How do I use this?

This script deletes everything on your phone, including the main OS if you are not downgrading to iOS 10.3.3 or later. Make sure to backup all of your data before using this script as **anything on the device prior to running this script will be unrecoverable afterwards**. Use this script at your own risk. We are not responsible for any damages caused by you using this script.

To use this app, you need to downgrade to a supported version, and have a supported device.

`xcode-select install` to install `git` on macos

`git clone https://github.com/y08wilm/Semaphorin && cd Semaphorin`

Connect device in DFU mode

`sudo ./semaphorin.sh <the version you are downgrading to> --restore`

For example you may write `sudo ./semaphorin.sh 9.3 --restore`

The script has to backup important files from your current iOS version before you can downgrade.

When the script asks `[*] Please enter the iOS version that is currently installed on your device.`, type your current iOS version and then hit the Enter key to continue.

It should then begin the process of downgrading your device. Please follow the on screen instructions. This might take a while. Your device will reboot multiple times.

If you downgraded to iOS 10 or later, please use the jailbreak app on your home screen to begin jailbreaking your device.

If you downgraded to iOS 9, please use https://jbme.ddw.nu from safari to begin jailbreaking your device.

## Subsequent runs after downgrade is finished

Connect device in DFU mode

`sudo ./semaphorin.sh <the version you downgraded to previously> --boot`

For example, if you downgraded to iOS 9.3, you would run `sudo ./semaphorin.sh 9.3 --boot`.

It should just boot to your requested iOS version normally.

## Requirements

macOS Catalina or later. The script only officially supports these versions.

Java 8 https://builds.openlogic.com/downloadJDK/openlogic-openjdk/8u262-b10/openlogic-openjdk-8u262-b10-mac-x64.pkg

Intel Mac. Hackintoshes with AMD CPUs will **NOT** work with this.

Stable internet connection. Please don't try using this with dial up...

At least 20GB of free space on your computer

USB Type-A port and Lightning cable. USB Type-C ports will **NOT** work with this script. If you're using a Mac that only has a USB-C port (such as 12" MacBooks, and late Intel MacBook Airs) a dongle/dock with a USB-A port should work just fine with a standard USB-A to Lightning cable.

Working iDevice: The script has to backup `apticket.der`, `sep-firmware.img4`, `Baseband`, and `keybags` from your device before you can downgrade to an older iOS version.

## Support

We now have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/WQWDBBYJTb) where you can get help with this project.

If, for whatever reason, that invite link does not work, please contact [wilm271](https://t.me/wilm271) on Telegram.

The Discord server is strictly for Semaphorin support only. Please don't bring personal issues into our server.

## Setup.app bypass

We will not be providing any support for any method of deleting `/Applications/Setup.app` with our script.

This is only to comply with [r/jailbreak](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/) and [r/LegacyJailbreak](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegacyJailbreak/) rules and guidelines.

The script will downgrade your iOS version and jailbreak the downgraded OS very easily, but will not allow for bypassing **any** sort of Activation Lock.

We back up the `activation_records` from your main OS prior to downgrading your device, so please make sure your main OS is activated before using this tool.

## Troubleshooting

   ### Deep sleep, device won't turn on after locking it, have to reboot.
   The issue that causes deep sleep is unfortunately **unfixable**. There is, however, a workaround to this:
      
      1. Add [this repo](julioverne.github.io) to Cydia after setup
      
      2. Search for the tweak Fiona
      
      3. Install it
      
      4. Profit
      
   *Note: This does slightly affect battery life due to the way it works. You probably aren't using this script for battery life though, are you.

   ### Unsupported OS
   The script only officially works on macOS 10.15 or later due to some limitations on the developer's end. You have to install one of those versions to use the script. Please do not ask us about this.

Linux and Windows support is not planned either, do not ask about this either.

   ### Unable to connect to WiFi networks, incorrect password.
   This is caused by an issue that's *impossible* to fix. You need to connect to an open WiFi network

   You can create one using the Internet Sharing feature on macOS or [linux-wifi-hotspot](https://github.com/lakinduakash/linux-wifi-hotspot) on, you guessed it, Linux if you prefer using another computer for this. 

   Be careful when doing this since *anyone* can connect to the open network you created. We are not responsible for **any** damages caused by doing this.

   ### Safari does not work (iOS 10)
   Use the FileManager app on the home screen instead. It is a drop in replacement for Safari, and has a built in download manager also. Until further notice, this does not work on iPads, due to it being missing from the home screen and not being able to launch the app from Safari. This may be fixed at a later date. Sorry for the inconvenience. As a workaround, for iPads only, you can sign into App Store and download https://apps.apple.com/us/app/unlimfilemanager/id456683394 from there.

   ### Cydia is absent (on iPads)
   iPads have uicache issues with most jailbreaking tools. To open Cydia, enter `cydia://` in Safari's address bar and press Enter.

   ### Meridian is absent (on iPads)
   iPads have uicache issues with most jailbreaking tools. To open Meridian, enter `meridian://` in Safari's address bar and press Enter. Until further notice, this does not work, due to Safari not working on that version of iOS. This may be fixed at a later date. Sorry for the inconvenience.

   ### Chimera is absent (on iPads)
   iPads have uicache issues with most jailbreaking tools. To open Chimera, enter `chimera://` in Safari's address bar and press Enter.

   ### Electra is absent (on iPads)
   iPads have uicache issues with most jailbreaking tools. To open Electra, enter `electra://` in Safari's address bar and press Enter.

   ### Terminal is absent (on iPads)
   iPads have uicache issues with most jailbreaking tools. To open Terminal, enter `mterminal://` in Safari's address bar and press Enter.  

   ### Safari and others apps broken (iOS 7)
   Reboot your device using Semaphorin. When the device boots back up, open the Terminal app on your home screen, and type `su -` and press Enter. When it asks for you for a password, type `alpine` and hit Enter. Then you can type `reload` and hit Enter. This will patch sandbox and load all your tweaks to allow all your apps and tweaks to work as normal. It may fail the first time due to a malloc error, just close out of Terminal and re open the app. Do the same process over again and it should respring the device. All the apps on your device should now be working properly if you follow these steps.
